**Welcome!**

On this site, you will find a lot of random ramblings. It will mainly feature IT content, but you may also find material that is not related to it at all.

Right now, the site is in its early stages. I expect to add more content in the near future and probably make some minor tweaks to the layout.

Thank you for your visit and I hope you find it interesting.
